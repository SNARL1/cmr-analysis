### Overview of contents

This repository contains data from capture-mark-recapture (CMR) surveys conducted on populations of the endangered [mountain yellow-legged frog](https://www.fws.gov/sacramento/es_species/Accounts/Amphibians-Reptiles/sn_yellow_legged_frog/documents/Mountain-Yellow-Legged-Frog-Conservation-Strategy-Signed-508.pdf), and the code to analyze the survey data. The results from these analyses are used to describe the status of frog populations of particular interest, including populations that were established using translocations or reintroductions (e.g., [Joseph and Knapp 2018](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2499)), and donor populations from which frogs are collected for translocations and reintroductions. Results from many of these analyses are included in a manuscript (in preparation) that describes the establishment dynamics of frog populations following translocations. 

This repository contains the following directories and files:
* `code/` directory: Contains `Rmd` files that describe the creation of all datasets for each site (`xxxxx_createdata_mrmr.Rmd`), and analysis of those data using the [mrmr](https://github.com/SNARL1/mrmr) package (`xxxx_analysis_mrmr.Rmd`). Raw data used by the `createdata` Rmd files are not provided (see `data/` directory for more information). As such, the `createdata` Rmd files are provided in an effort to be as transparent as possible about how the raw data were processed to create the clean data. 
* `data/` directory: Contains cleaned data that are error-checked and formatted for use in `mrmr`. Raw data are not provided because information in some fields could reveal the locations of these sensitive frog populations.  
* `doc/` directory: Contains a notebook file that describes the status of each frog population at which CMR surveys are conducted
* `out/` directory: Contains the following directories and files:
  * `plots/` directory: Plots displaying frog survival, adult frog abundance, and frog recruitment. These plots are also provided in the `doc/notebook`. 
  * `model/` directory: Model fit `Rds` files.
  * `notebooks_code/`: Html-rendered "notebooks" of all `Rmd` files and their associated outputs. The html version of notebooks can be useful for reviewing the analysis outputs (e.g., plots and tables) for each population without having to run the code in the associated `xxxxx_analysis_mrmr.Rmd` files. The "Viewing Notebooks" section below describes options for viewing the notebooks without downloading the repository contents. 
  * `tables/` directory: Tables displaying the survival of translocated frogs, by cohort and by individual.

Numerous files are included in the repository that can be generated by the code (e.g., notebooks, figures). 
This is done to make these files available to users who may be unable to run the code. 

All sites are referenced only by 5-digit unique identifiers. No site names or x-y coordinates are provided to protect these sensitive populations to the maximum extent possible. 

### Viewing notebooks

HTML-rendered notebooks are available in the `doc/` and `out/` directories. 
Notebooks in the `out/` directory contain details of the data creation steps and analysis results for each population.  
The notebook in the `doc/` directory provides general summaries of the status of each frog population, based on results in `analysis` notebooks in the `out\` directory. 
To view an HTML-rendered notebook directly from this repository (and not instead see the HTML source code when you open the file), click on the notebook you want 
view and add this prefix to the URL displayed in the address bar: `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?`. For example, for the notebook file 
`notebook_results.nb.html`, add `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the notebook's URL

`https://github.com/SNARL1/cmr-analysis/blob/main/doc/notebook/notebook_results.nb.html`

to get 

`https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SNARL1/cmr-analysis/blob/main/doc/notebook/notebook_results.nb.html`. 

Hit "Return" or "Enter" on your keyboard and the HTML-rendered notebook will appear. 

If, after clicking on the notebook file, you see a message that the notebook file is too big to view, click the "View raw" link or "Download" button, and add the address prefix as described above.
