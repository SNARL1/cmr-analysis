## Overview

This notebook contains a summary of results obtained from the analysis
of capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from mountain yellow-legged frog
populations in California’s Sierra Nevada. These data are collected by
the [Mountain Lakes Research Group](https://mountainlakesresearch.com),
usually on an annual basis. The intent of this notebook is to provide a
single file where researchers and managers can obtain information about
the current status of these populations, many of which are critically
important for the recovery of this species. Data from visual encounter
surveys are also included in the summary to augment the results from CMR
surveys. This information is updated annually as data from the most
recent summer field season is analyzed.

In the following summary, populations are categorized as “Donor
populations”, “Translocated populations”, and “Reintroduced
populations”, and within these categories populations are identified by
their five-digit site id. Unless otherwise noted, frogs in all
populations are infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus,
*Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (Bd). Unlike the severe effects caused
by Bd following its initial arrival in these populations, usually
decades ago, many of these populations are now co-existing with Bd. The
reasons for this changed dynamic are under study, and appear to involve
evolutionary changes in frogs that have made them less susceptible to
chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by Bd.

## Donor populations

## Translocated populations

### 70134

#### Survival

-   Very low 1-year survival of the 2006 cohort of translocated frogs
    (0.12). Only six adults seen in 2007 and none thereafter.
-   *T. elegans* never seen at site, so likely not responsible for low
    survival.

#### Reproduction

-   No evidence of reproduction was ever seen.

### 70370

#### Survival

-   Very low 1-year survival of both the 2016 and 2018 translocated
    cohorts (0.04 and 0.17, respectively).
-   Habitat looks very good for *R. sierrae* for both summer and winter,
    so it remains unclear what the factor limiting frog survival at this
    site is. It is unlikely related to winter oxygen levels in the water
    because trout thrived here for decades.

#### Reproduction

-   No evidence of reproduction was ever observed.

#### Population size

-   Population size returned to near-zero within one year of each
    translocation.
-   The absence of any frogs during the 2020 survey suggests that the
    population is extirpated.

### 70413

#### Survival

-   Relatively high 1-year survival of the 2013, 2015, and 2017 cohorts
    of translocated frogs (0.69, 0.64, 0.56, respectively).

#### Reproduction

-   Egg masses, tadpoles, and/or subadults have been observed annually
    starting in 2014, with a maximum count summed across all sites of
    800 in 2015.
-   Subadults were first observed in 2015 and are always seen in
    relatively low numbers (maximum count = 27).

#### Recruitment

-   Recruitment of new adults was first observed in 2016, and has
    occurred in all years since.
-   Number of new recruits seems quite regular, with 20, 15, and 24
    recruits tagged in 2018, 2020, and 2021, respectively.

#### Population size

-   From 2017 to early-2021 (i.e., prior to translocation and
    reintroduction of 117 frogs), estimated population size across all
    sites was stable at approximately 50 adults in each year.
-   This population, although still relatively small given the abundant
    high quality habitat, appears well-established and self-sustaining.
-   The 2021 translocation and reintroduction is likely to substantially
    increase the population size.

### 70414

#### Survival

-   Very low 1-year survival of the 2006 cohort of translocated frogs
    (0.01), and no adults seen in 2007.
-   Number of *T. elegans* appeared to increase markedly following
    translocation, may have been at least partially responsible for low
    survival.

#### Reproduction

-   No evidence of reproduction was ever seen.

### 70449

#### Survival

-   Intermediate level of survival of the 2014 cohort of translocated
    frogs (0.35).
-   Survival of the 2017 cohort of translocated frogs was somewhat
    higher (0.53).
-   More frogs found dead at this site than is typically the case at
    other sites. Whether this is due to site characteristics (e.g., lack
    of hiding cover) that make carcasses easier to detect, or population
    characteristics (i.e., relatively low survival) is unknown.
-   Adult frogs at this site commonly feed on HYRE tadpoles and
    subadults and are very well-fed. It would be interesting to know
    whether these frogs grow quickly but have short life spans compared
    to frogs at higher elevations.

#### Reproduction

-   Egg masses, tadpoles, and/or subadults have been observed annually
    since 2015, but always in relatively small numbers (maximum count =
    80 tadpoles).
-   The relatively low numbers are likely due to high habitat complexity
    and the fact that at this elevation tadpoles often do not aggregrate
    near shore.

#### Recruitment

-   Recruitment of new adults has occurred in most years since 2016,
    with a maximum number of 15 in 2016.
-   Substantial recruitment occurred in 2016, just two years after the
    first translocation. This indicates that at this relatively low
    elevation site, the transition from egg to adult can occur in only
    1.5 years.
-   Recruitment does not appear to be particularly episodic, in contrast
    to what is observed at some other sites.

#### Population size

-   Population appears to have stabilized at 20-25 adults. Although
    smaller than hoped for, this may be a typical population size at
    this elevation due to predation from snakes and invertebrate
    predators.

### 70505

#### Survival

-   Low 1-year survival of the 2008, 2013, 2015, and 2017 cohorts of
    translocated frogs (0.19, 0.16, 0.10, 0.10).

#### Reproduction

-   Tadpoles and/or subadults seen in every year starting in 2010.
-   Counts of these life stages are generally low (\< 25), but the 200
    tadpoles counted in 2018 were an obvious exception.

#### Recruitment

-   First new recruits into the adult population were observed in 2012.
-   Some recruitment of new adults occurred in most years, including
    12-17 recruits per year in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

#### Population size

-   Estimated population size in the last survey year (2018) was
    approximately 6 adults.
-   This small population size is likely due to survival of adults being
    low enough to preclude population growth, even with 4 translocations
    and natural recruitment of adults in several years.
-   Available evidence suggests that, at best, this site will support
    only a small frog population, and conducting additional
    translocations will likely not alter that outcome.

### 70550

#### Survival

-   Relatively high 1-year survival of the 2006 cohort of translocated
    frogs (0.61).
-   Survival of 2013 cohort of translocated frogs was substantially
    lower (0.29).

#### Reproduction

-   Tadpoles and subadults were first observed in 2008.
-   Both life stages were observed in all subsequent surveys
    (2008-2021), and in much higher numbers than in any other
    translocated population.
-   Since 2016, tadpole counts from visual encounter surveys have often
    exceeded 1500 individuals.

#### Recruitment

-   The first recruit into the adult population was observed in 2010,
    and except for 2011, new recruits have been tagged in every
    subsequent year (2010, 2012-2021).
-   Recruitment magnitude is highly variable between years, with notably
    large recruitment events in 2016 and 2021, and lower but substantial
    recruitment in several additional years (2013, 2014, 2018, 2020).
-   This variation may result from an interaction between subadult
    survival, Bd infection, and winter severity.

#### Population size

-   Following the original translocation in 2006, the estimated
    population was \< 50 adults until 2013. During 2013-2015, the
    population increased to 100-150 adults. Since the large recruitment
    event in 2016, the population has fluctuated between 170 and 420
    adults, with an average population size of approximately 250 adults.
-   This population is now well-established, and is large enough to
    serve as a donor of frogs for future frog recovery actions.
-   The 16-year mark-recapture dataset has allowed unprecedented
    insights into the dynamics of population establishment. It is also
    allowing us to test hypotheses regarding the drivers of the observed
    population dynamics, information that is critical for the design and
    implementation of future frog recovery actions.

### 70556

#### Survival

-   Relatively high 1-year survival of the 2018 cohort of translocated
    frogs (0.73).
-   Survival of 2020 cohort of translocated frogs was lower, but still
    high (0.61).
-   Not as high as 74976 despite both sites receiving frogs from same
    donor population and in the same two years.

#### Reproduction

-   Successful reproduction occurred in 2019 (based on 2nd-year tads
    seen in 2020), 2020 (1st-year tads), and 2021 (1st-year tads).
-   2019 cohort was not seen until 2020 (07-07) and was made up of only
    \~15 tadpoles. Suggests limited reproduction in 2019 and/or low
    survival during 2019-2020 winter.
-   2020 cohort contained at least 425 individuals, based on count
    conducted on 08-23. Tadpole count on 2021-07-22 indicated 350
    second-year animals, suggesting high overwinter survival of
    first-year tadpoles compared to that shown by 2019 cohort (perhaps
    due to light 2020 snow year –> long 2020 summer –> large tadpole
    size going into 2021 winter).
-   2021 cohort contained approximately 435 individuals, based on count
    conducted on 2021-08-26.
-   First metamorphs seen in 2021 (1 on 07-22 and 13 on 08-26), small
    numbers likely due to small size of the 2019 cohort. Expect a
    substantially larger number of metamorphs in 2022 from 2021 cohort.

#### Recruitment

-   As expected for this high elevation site, no recruitment of new
    adults has occurred yet.
-   Unlikely that metamorphs in 2021 will grow to adult size by 2022, so
    recruitment may not be observed until 2023.

#### Population size

-   2021 estimated population size is approximately 25 adults.
-   All adults seen in northern 1/3 or 1/2 of lake.

### 70619

#### Survival

-   1-year survival of the 2008 cohort is low (0.22).
-   As seen at other sites, despite lack of gartersnakes, population
    declined substantially during summer 2008 following translocation.
    Mortality caused by Bd? Poor-quality habitat?

#### Reproduction

-   Tadpoles seen during most surveys conducted after 2011, but always
    in relatively small numbers (&le 25). No obvious basking habitat for
    tadpoles in lake due to steeply sloped littoral zone dominated by
    large boulders. Subadults seen occasionally.

#### Recruitment

-   Only evidence of recruitment was in 2019 when four untagged and
    relatively small adults were captured and tagged.

#### Population size

-   Estimated population size declined relatively rapidly during summer
    2018, and since 2012 has been near zero.

<img src="../../out/plots/70619_mrmr_plots.png" style="width:75.0%" />

### 70628

#### Survival

-   1-year survival of the 2020 cohort is 0.65. Seems quite high for
    frogs from the 72996 donor population.

#### Reproduction

-   No tadpoles seen during the 2021-08-10 VES, but hopefully will be
    observed during surveys in 2022.

#### Recruitment

-   No recruitment expected until at least 2024.

#### Population size

-   2021 estimated population size is approximately 17 adults

<img src="../../out/plots/70628_mrmr_plots.png" style="width:75.0%" />

### 70641

#### Survival

-   The three translocated cohorts (2015, 2017, 2020) have all shown low
    1-year survival (0.27, 0.16, 0.07, respectively).
-   Gartersnakes present at site, but within months of translocation
    frogs grow to large sizes that provide a refuge from predation.
-   Frogs at this site grow quickly and attain large sizes (up to 82 mm
    SVL - in 2021)

#### Reproduction

-   Reproduction in this population is difficult to assess because
    non-adult life stages are rarely seen due to thick littoral zone
    vegetation.
-   No tadpoles have been observed during VES, and the only subadult
    observed was in 2019.
-   However, new adult recruits have been captured, so some reproduction
    is obviously occurring.

#### Recruitment

-   A total of 4 new (untagged) frogs have been captured, including 1 in
    2017, 2 in 2019, and 1 in 2020.

#### Population size

-   The 2021 estimated population size is near 0.

<img src="../../out/plots/70641_mrmr_plots.png" style="width:75.0%" />

### 74976

#### Survival

-   Unusually high 1-year survival of the 2018 cohort of translocated
    frogs (0.94).
-   Survival of 2020 cohort of translocated frogs was lower, but still
    high (0.67).

#### Reproduction

-   Successful reproduction (as evidenced by first-year tadpoles)
    observed in 2019, 2020, and 2021.
-   2019 cohort contained at least 250 individuals, based on count
    conducted on 09-Sep-2019. Cohort appeared to experience relatively
    low overwinter survival (perhaps due to the heavy 2019 snow year –>
    short 2019 summer –> small tadpole size going into 2020 winter),
    with approximately 25 second-year tadpoles counted on 20-Aug-2020. 5
    metamorphs seen during the August 2020 CMR.
-   2020 cohort contained at least 320 individuals, based on count
    conducted on 20-Aug-2020. Tadpole count on 25-Jun-2021 indicated 386
    second-year animals, suggesting high overwinter survival of
    first-year tadpoles compared to that shown by 2019 cohort (perhaps
    due to light 2020 snow year –> long 2020 summer –> large tadpole
    size going into 2021 winter).
-   2021 cohort contained at least 305 individuals, based on count
    conducted on 18-Aug-2021.
-   Many subadults counted during mid-August 2021 survey (203), compared
    to very few in late-summer 2020.

#### Recruitment

-   First new recruits into the adult population (5) captured during
    mid-August 2021 CMR survey. Likely all from 2019 cohort, but large
    size range (41-50 mm) suggests that these adults were from animals
    that metamorphosed in both late-summer 2020 and early-summer 2021.

#### Population size

-   2021 estimated population size is approximately 28 adults.
-   As of mid-August 2021, frog population extends from Lower Pool
    outlet to 72973.
-   72973 (uppermost pond) was colonized by adults and metamorphs
    in 2020.
-   All reproduction is occurring in 74976.
-   Population seems likely to become firmly established in next few
    years.

## Reintroduced populations
